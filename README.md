# ovito-scripts

A collection of scripts for pairing [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/) with [freud](https://freud.readthedocs.io/), [signac](https://signac.readthedocs.io/), and other Glotzer lab software.

The `cmaps` directory contains images that can be loaded as OVITO colormaps and scripts to generate those images.

The scripts named `modifier_*.py` are meant to be loaded as [Python script pipeline modifiers](https://www.ovito.org/docs/current/particles.modifiers.python_script.php).

The scripts named `overlay_*.py` are meant to be loaded as [Python script viewport layers](https://www.ovito.org/docs/current/viewport_layers.python_script.php).
